        <section id="load-data">
            <h2>Load Data</h2>
            <p>The code loads battery health data from a CSV file using pd.read_csv() function. The path to the CSV file should be specified in the file_path variable.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="preprocessing">
            <h2>Preprocessing</h2>
            <p>The input features (X) and target variable (y) are defined from the loaded data. In this case, the input feature is 'Capacity (Ah)' and the target variable is 'SOH'.

                The data is then normalized using Min-Max scaling to ensure that all the features are in the range [0, 1].</p>
        </section>

        <section id="train-test-split">
            <h2>Train-Test Split</h2>
            <p>The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split() function from sklearn. The testing set size is set to 20% of the total data, and the random state is set to 42.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="reshape-data">
            <h2>Reshape Data</h2>
            <p>The training and testing data is reshaped to match the input shape required by the LSTM model. The new shape is (samples, time steps, features), where time steps is set to 1 and features is the number of input features.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="build-lstm-model">
            <h2>Build LSTM Model</h2>
            <p>The LSTM model is built using Sequential() from tensorflow.keras.models. The model consists of an LSTM layer with 50 units, followed by a Dense layer with 1 unit. The activation function for the output layer is set to 'linear' for regression.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="compile-model">
            <h2>Compile Model</h2>
            <p>The model is compiled using model.compile() function. The optimizer is set to 'adam' and the loss function is set to 'mean_squared_error', which is commonly used for regression tasks.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="train-model">
            <h2>Train Model</h2>
            <p>The model is trained using model.fit(). The training data (X_train and y_train) is passed to the function along with the number of epochs (50) and batch size (32). The validation data (X_test and y_test) is also passed for monitoring the model's performance during training.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="evaluate-model">
            <h2>Evaluate Model</h2>
            <p>EThe trained model is evaluated using model.evaluate() function. The testing data (X_test and y_test) is passed to the function, and the mean squared error (MSE) loss is computed and stored in the variable loss. The loss value represents the model's performance on unseen data.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="make-predictions">
            <h2>Make Predictions</h2>
            <p>The model is used to make predictions on the testing data using model.predict(). The predictions are stored in the variable predictions.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="inverse-transform">
            <h2>Inverse Transform</h2>
            <p>The predictions and actual values (y_test) are inverse transformed using scaler_y.inverse_transform() to convert them back to the original scale.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="plot-results">
            <h2>Plot Results</h2>
            <p>The results are plotted using matplotlib.pyplot. Two plots are created:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Scatter Plot: A scatter plot comparing the predicted SOH values (predictions_inv) and the true SOH values (y_test_inv) is created. The data points are marked with different markers to distinguish between the predicted and true values. The x-axis represents the data points, and the y-axis represents the SOH values.</li>
           <li>Line Plot: A line plot showing the true SOH values (y_test_inv) and the predicted SOH values (predictions_inv) is created. The x-axis represents the data points, and the y-axis represents the SOH values. The x-axis limits are adjusted for better visualization.</li>
