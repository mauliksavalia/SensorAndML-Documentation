<p>The following code is written in Arduino and it uses an IR sensor to detect the presence of a drone. It prints a message to the serial monitor depending on whether a drone is detected or not.</p>
    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p>irSensor1: This constant variable is assigned the value 4, which represents the pin number to which the IR sensor is connected.</p>
<p>x: This integer variable is used to store the digital value read from the IR sensor.</p>
<h3>SETUP</h3>
<p>The setup() function is called once when the Arduino is powered on or reset. It performs the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sets the pinMode of irSensor1 as INPUT, indicating that it is a digital input pin.</li>
    <li>Initializes the Serial communication by calling the begin() function with a baud rate of 9600</li>
</ul>
<h3>Loop</h3>
<p>The loop() function is called repeatedly as long as the Arduino is powered on. It performs the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reads the digital value from irSensor1 and stores it in the variable x using the digitalRead() function.</li>
    <li>Checks if x is less than 1. If true, it prints "Drone Detected!" to the serial monitor using the println() function of the Serial object.</li>
    <li>If x is not less than 1, it prints "Not in a Range!" to the serial monitor.</li>
    <li>Adds a delay of 200 milliseconds before the next iteration of the loop is executed using the delay() function.</li>
</ul>
